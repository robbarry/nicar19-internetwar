# NICAR19 Cyberwar

### Cyberwar: Investigating hacking by advanced actors
*Speakers: Rob Barry of The Wall Street Journal; Surya Mattu of The Markup*

How to investigate warfare’s newest front: the cyber realm. We'll walk you through getting more information about this secretive world, including tracking down information about who owns what on the internet, disentangling server logs, studying IP addresses and analyzing malware and emails and more in this session. We’ll also talk about some of the tactics advanced hackers have used in the past to penetrate sensitive networks--and how those efforts can provide clues in future attacks.

## Tipsheet

Here are some useful tools:

* [FarSight](https://www.farsightsecurity.com/solutions/) - Excellent source of passive DNS data. They like reporters, so reach out and ask them for an API key.
* [DomainTools](http://domaintools.com) - Historical WHOIS for domains; website snapshots; search WHOIS and historical WHOIS; SSL certificates
* [RiskIQ](https://community.riskiq.com/home) - Historical WHOIS for both IPs and domains; SSL certificates; email addresses; "trackers" (like Google Analytics code); passive DNS data.
* [SecurityTrails](https://securitytrails.com/) - Passive DNS data
* [PublicWWW.com](https://publicwww.com/) - Like Google, but also indexes HTML and JavaScript
* [BuiltWith](https://builtwith.com/) - Detects technologies used by websites
* [SimilarWeb](https://www.similarweb.com/) - Detects technologies used by websites
* [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/) - Identifies devices and services on IPs
* [Censys](https://censys.io/) - Scans every IP on the internet and stores details
* [BGP Toolkit](https://bgp.he.net/) - Lots of information about ASNs and BGP routes, current and historical
* [Robtex](https://www.robtex.com/) - One-stop shop for lots of information about IP addresses and domains
* [Masscan](https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan)/[NMAP](https://nmap.org/) - Tools for analyzing open ports on specific IP addresses
* [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) - Analyze suspicious files and URLs to detect types of malware, see linkages
* [urlscan.io](https://urlscan.io/) - Scan content of any site, study all HTTP calls and lots of other information, historical search data
* [VMRay](https://www.vmray.com/) - Analyze what programs do (this thing is amazing)
* [WebRecorder.io](https://webrecorder.io/) - Capture interactive web session
* [Project Sonar](https://www.rapid7.com/research/project-sonar/) - DNS and SSL data. Good details [here](https://0xpatrik.com/project-sonar-guide/).

- [Aircrack-ng](https://www.aircrack-ng.org) - Its been around for ages and does all things wifi	
- [Debookee](https://debookee.com/) - Easy to use network investigation tool. Has a lot of powerful features. Mac only unfortunately 
- [MITMProxy](https://mitmproxy.org) - Tool written in python that makes it very easy to listen to network traffic going through your devices
- [N.S.HEyyyy](https://github.com/samatt/nsheyy_gui/releases) - This is a tool Surya made ages ago for Wi-Fi scanning in monitor mode on OSX. It probably doesnt work anymore but the code for doing the scanning will still work if you need it
- [Herbivore](https://github.com/samatt/herbivore) - A tool made by Jen Kagan and Surya. Its a work in progress but is designed to be a gentle introduction to packet sniffing
