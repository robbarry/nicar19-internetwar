### Cyberwar: Investigating hacking by advanced actors
*Speakers: Rob Barry of The Wall Street Journal; Surya Mattu of The Markup*

How to investigate warfare’s newest front: the cyber realm. We'll walk you through getting more information about this secretive world, including tracking down information about who owns what on the internet, disentangling server logs, studying IP addresses and analyzing malware and emails and more in this session. We’ll also talk about some of the tactics advanced hackers have used in the past to penetrate sensitive networks--and how those efforts can provide clues in future attacks.

## Tipsheet

Here are some useful tools:

* [FarSight](https://www.farsightsecurity.com/solutions/) - Excellent source of passive DNS data. They like reporters, so reach out and ask them for an API key.
* [DomainTools](http://domaintools.com) - Historical WHOIS for domains; website snapshots; search WHOIS and historical WHOIS; SSL certificates
* [RiskIQ](https://community.riskiq.com/home) - Historical WHOIS for both IPs and domains; SSL certificates; email addresses; "trackers" (like Google Analytics code); passive DNS data.
* [SecurityTrails](https://securitytrails.com/) - Passive DNS data
* [PublicWWW.com](https://publicwww.com/) - Like Google, but also indexes HTML and JavaScript
* [BuiltWith](https://builtwith.com/) - Detects technologies used by websites
